# Loan Applicant Risk Segmentation

## Overview

In this project, we aim to classify loan applicants into different risk segments using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains various features such as **Age**, **Total Work Experience**, **Years in City**, **Cost to Request Ratio**, and other relevant information about applicants. These features are leveraged to build a model that classifies applicants based on their risk of defaulting on a loan.

By accurately segmenting applicants into low, medium, and high-risk categories, financial institutions can make better-informed decisions about loan approvals, ultimately reducing the risk of financial loss.

### Key Features:
- **Data-driven Risk Segmentation**: Classify loan applicants into various risk categories (low, medium, high).
- **Feature Engineering**: Utilize applicant's demographic and financial data to build a robust predictive model.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Use classification models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict the loan risk.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using various evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

- **Age**: The applicant's age.
- **Total Work Experience**: The total number of years the applicant has worked in their professional career.
- **Years in City**: The number of years the applicant has been residing in their current city.
- **Cost to Request Ratio**: The ratio of the requested loan amount to the applicant's annual income, providing insight into their debt burden.
- **Income**: Monthly income of the applicant.
- **Credit Score**: The applicant's creditworthiness score.
- **Existing Debt**: The total amount of debt the applicant currently holds.
- **Loan Amount**: The loan amount requested by the applicant.

The dataset is available in the `data/` directory of this repository.
